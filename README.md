# READ THIS.
Hello reader. Although yes I have changed the code to include my username and Discord ID, I do not claim any of these as mine. Marek created these plugins but they were accused of token logging users (with proof it seems). So I went ahead and removed all of the sus shit so these can be used again. **I cannot guarantee that I will maintain these if anything breaks**, sorry.

If I missed anything; feel free to open a pull request.
