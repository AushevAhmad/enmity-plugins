# READ THIS.
Hello reader. Although yes I have changed the code to include my username and Discord ID, I do not claim any of Marek's plugins as mine. Marek created some of these plugins but they were accused of adding some RCE to one of their plugins. So I went ahead and removed all of the sus shit so these can be used again. **I cannot guarantee that I will maintain these if anything breaks**, sorry.

If I missed anything; feel free to open a pull request.
